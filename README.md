# Verns-Video-Project

This was my year-end project for my AP Computer Science A course. I already turned it in, but I am coming back to it and I wnat to add the following list of updates:

-add security like password system

-password to delete accounts

-edit accounts

-tells when next copy is going to be returned by

-add pricing system

-remember the pathway to the movielist used last time

-add auto-import list setting

It uses the list of movies in the .txt file and saves it to that
