# Verns-Video-Store-Project

This was my year-end project for my AP Computer Science A course. It was meant to emulate an interface for a video store like Blockbuster, where people can come and rent movies. I already turned it in, but I am coming back to it and I wnat to add the following list of updates:

-add security like password system

-password to delete accounts

-edit accounts

-tells when next copy is going to be returned by

-add pricing system

-remember the pathway to the movielist used last time

-add auto-import list setting

It uses the list of movies in the .txt file and saves it to that. Opening Main is just a way of opening Verns that looks cleaner because Verns contains quite a bit of the code.
